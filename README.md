# First_simple_web_app
Just puts up a couple images with minimal data wrangling about global temperatures

### Packages needed
* Python
* flask 
* pandas
* plotly 

(Helpful to install them in a local enviornment)

### How to get it up and running
To actually run the web app you will need to run the myapp.py file and then open up a tab in your browser using the folling format:
https://WORKSPACEID-3001.WORKSPACEDOMAIN

- Except you will have to replace both the WORKSPACEID and WORKSPACEDOMAIN with the appropriate input. To find these inputs, simply type 

evn | grep WORK

into your terminal window and you should be prompted with the corresponding input text.
